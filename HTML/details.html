            <p class="question">Can I bring a date?</p>
            <p class="answer">As this will be a small, intimate event, please limit your party to those listed on your invitation.</p>

            <p class="question">What time should I arrive?</p>

            <p class="question">Should I research some new dance moves?</p>
            <p class="answer">As you may know, Kevin and Asia aren’t what some would call “dancey” – music and a dance floor will be available for anyone 
                to enjoy, but the couple will be spending the majority of the evening mingling, posing for photos, and refilling their plates.</p>

            <p class="question">Which airport should I fly into? </p>
            <p class="answer">Portland International Airport (PDX)</p>

            <p class="question">Is there lodging nearby?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes, X is Y distance from the venue, A is B distance, etc<br>For more lodging options, Portland is full of hotels and Airbnbs for all preferences and budgets</p>

                <ul>
